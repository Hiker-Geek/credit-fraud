# credit-fraud

The goal of this project is to create a credit fraud detection program in python. More than just creating a singular algorithm to fine tune, this project focuses on the various ways in which credit fraud detection may be implemented and compares their performance using the measures of accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure, as well as taking labor and runtime into account to find the most efficient algorithm with the best results. Full details of this project are reported in the CreditCardFraudProjectPaper.pdf.

We implemented three methods for comparison: deep neural networks, classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree), and anomaly detection (LOF) algorithms.
